# LeCrown Platform

Multi-tenant backend and admin surface for:

- `lecrowndevelopment.com`
- `lecrownproperties.com`

The platform keeps content, transformation, distribution, tenant-scoped inquiry handling, and cross-site intake inside one codebase. The current tenant-scoped paths still use `development` or `properties`, while generalized lead ingestion starts at `POST /intake/lead`.

## Structure

```text

```

## What is implemented

- FastAPI backend with tenant-aware `content`, `inquiry`, `linkedin`, `youtube`, `distribution`, `intake`, and `auth` routes
- Stripe-backed billing API for shared app accounts, checkout, customer portal, webhook sync, and entitlement lookup
- SQLite persistence through SQLAlchemy
- Minimal React admin for creating canonical content, choosing output channels, and viewing property inquiries
- Transform layer that adapts one content record into channel-specific payloads
- LinkedIn publish service wired to tenant-specific organization IDs
- YouTube upload service wired for per-tenant OAuth access or refresh tokens
- Intake pipeline that stores inbound site leads and forwards them to `EspoCRM`
- Video worker client that can call a separate render server over HTTP or run in stub mode

## Licensed HAR Back Office

The platform-owned handoff for an agents-only Repliers / HAR property
intelligence workspace starts at:

- [docs/repliers-har/README.md](/Users/benjaminlagrone/Documents/projects/real-estate/lecrown-properties-platform/docs/repliers-har/README.md)

Current state is `licensing approved`, while the portal remains `sample-only`
and no HAR response has been validated. The initial implementation must use
synthetic fixtures and the existing authenticated admin boundary. Live provider
calls, credentials, deployment, CRM writes, outreach, public listing display,
and bulk export remain separately gated.

## LeCrown Sign

The platform's first-party transaction-signing target and the validated local
Signing Rooms reference prototype are documented at:

- [LeCrown Sign Prototype Handoff](./docs/lecrown-sign-prototype-handoff.md)
- [LeCrown Properties Back-Office Execution Roadmap](./docs/real-estate-backoffice-execution-roadmap.md#lecrown-sign-execution-specification)

Current state is `reference prototype only`. The prototype is not integrated
into this repository, deployed to `sign.lecrownproperties.com`, or approved for
live client signatures. Production delivery, identity, server-side custody,
tamper-resistant finalization, retention, and broker/legal/security acceptance
remain gated.

## Local run

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend/admin
npm install
npm run dev
```

The admin app defaults to `http://localhost:8000` for the API.

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` before running the stack locally.

For production:

- build the back office with `VITE_API_BASE_URL=/api`
- set `PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://backoffice.lecrownproperties.com`
- set `CORS_ORIGINS` to the public admin origin
- include `backoffice.lecrownproperties.com` in `ALLOWED_HOSTS`
- replace the default `SECRET_KEY` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
- set `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, and `BILLING_SERVICE_KEYS` before enabling billing flows
- leave `GMAIL_RFQ_FEED_URL` blank unless the Gmail RFQ sidecar service exists in that environment

## Content model shape

Canonical content is stored once and carries distribution intent plus media state:

```json
{
  "tenant": "development",
  "type": "insight",
  "title": "Why warehouse operations break down",
  "body": "Communication failures create delays and cost leakage.",
  "tags": ["operations", "industrial"],
  "distribution": {
    "linkedin": true,
    "youtube": true,
    "website": true,
    "twitter": false
  },
  "media": {
    "video_generated": false,
    "video_path": "/videos/warehouse.mp4",
    "video_url": null,
    "render_status": null,
    "render_job_id": null,
    "youtube_video_id": null,
    "youtube_status": null
  }
}
```

## Docker run

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Backend: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

The Docker frontend image now builds static assets and serves them through `nginx`, which is suitable for production-style deployments.

## Distribution flow

The platform now follows:

```text
content -> transform -> distribute
```

Current channel support:

- `linkedin`: implemented
- `youtube`: implemented
- `website`: placeholder response in the distribution controller
- `twitter`: stub publisher placeholder

Video generation ownership:

- The API orchestrates render requests.
- A separate worker is expected to produce the video.
- The backend can call that worker over HTTP through [backend/app/services/video_client.py](/Users/benjaminlagrone/Documents/projects/real-estate/lecrown-properties-platform/backend/app/services/video_client.py).

## MediaStudio APIs

`MediaStudio` is now documented as an external API suite that `lecrown-platform` can use for media generation and rendering.

See:

- [docs/mediastudio-apis.md](/Users/benjaminlagrone/Documents/projects/real-estate/lecrown-properties-platform/docs/mediastudio-apis.md)

Current stance:

- preferred render worker target: `rs-video-stitch`
- faster all-in-one media backend: `video-gen`
- supporting narration backend: `audio_xtts`
- supporting music backend: `musicService`

## Intake Hub

`lecrown-platform` now includes the first platform-owned cross-site intake route:

- `POST /intake/lead`

Current behavior:

- accepts a source-aware lead payload from an external site
- stores the raw submission in the platform database
- stores a normalized internal representation
- forwards the mapped lead to `EspoCRM`
- stores downstream delivery status and response metadata

Current first target:

- `AskMortgageAuthority`

## Billing API

`lecrown-platform` now exposes a platform billing surface for other LeCrown apps.

Current implementation:

- platform-owned `accounts`, `account_memberships`, `products`, `prices`, `entitlements`, `billing_customers`, `billing_subscriptions`, and `billing_webhook_events`
- hosted Stripe Checkout Session creation for subscription signup
- Stripe Customer Portal session creation for self-service billing management
- webhook-driven subscription synchronization into account-scoped entitlements
- app-scoped entitlement lookup for runtime enforcement in external projects

App-facing billing routes expect:

- `X-Billing-App: <app_key>`
- `X-Billing-Key: <shared_secret>`

`BILLING_SERVICE_KEYS` should be configured as comma-separated `app_key:secret` pairs.

## Feature Roadmap

Product direction:

- `lecrown-platform` should become the internet publishing focal point
- the publishing surface should cover blogs, `Twitter/X`, and other social sites
- multi-account publishing should be a first-class capability across brands, pages, sites, and operator accounts
- it should also act as the capture point for forms across different sites and funnel those submissions into the CRM

See:

- [docs/feature-roadmap.md](/Users/benjaminlagrone/Documents/projects/real-estate/lecrown-properties-platform/docs/feature-roadmap.md)
- [docs/billing-platform-strategy.md](/Users/benjaminlagrone/Documents/projects/real-estate/lecrown-properties-platform/docs/billing-platform-strategy.md)
- [docs/lecrown-billing-workflow-spec.md](/Users/benjaminlagrone/Documents/projects/real-estate/lecrown-properties-platform/docs/lecrown-billing-workflow-spec.md)

## Government Contracting Knowledge

The platform's government-contracting knowledge package preserves the UH APEX
source documents and turns them into a certification, buyer, prime-contractor,
subcontracting, and supplier-diversity operating plan.

See:

- [Government Contracting Knowledge Base](/Users/benjaminlagrone/Documents/projects/real-estate/lecrown-properties-platform/docs/government-contracting/README.md)
- [Subcontracting and Market-Access Plan](/Users/benjaminlagrone/Documents/projects/real-estate/lecrown-properties-platform/docs/government-contracting/subcontracting-market-access-plan.md)
- [Government Contracts Platform Guide](/Users/benjaminlagrone/Documents/projects/real-estate/lecrown-properties-platform/docs/gov-contracts.md)

## CRM Direction

`lecrown-platform` should not be treated as the final cross-business CRM.

Current position:

- keep the built-in `/inquiry` flow narrow and tenant-specific
- use `EspoCRM` as the shared operational CRM across businesses
- integrate with CRM over API boundaries instead of rebuilding everything in this repo too early

See:

- [docs/espocrm-strategy.md](/Users/benjaminlagrone/Documents/projects/real-estate/lecrown-properties-platform/docs/espocrm-strategy.md)

This is especially important because the current inquiry model is still `properties`-specific, while the CRM direction now spans:

- `LeCrown Properties`
- `AskMortgageAuthority`
- future businesses

## Site Integration References

Other sites should integrate against shared APIs, not shared folders or direct code imports.

Reference docs:

- [Site Integration Overview](/Users/benjaminlagrone/Documents/projects/real-estate/lecrown-properties-platform/docs/site-integration-overview.md)
- [Site API Reference](/Users/benjaminlagrone/Documents/projects/real-estate/lecrown-properties-platform/docs/site-api-reference.md)
- [Site Integration Checklist](/Users/benjaminlagrone/Documents/projects/real-estate/lecrown-properties-platform/docs/site-integration-checklist.md)
- [AskMortgageAuthority Integration](/Users/benjaminlagrone/Documents/projects/real-estate/lecrown-properties-platform/docs/askmortgageauthority-integration.md)
- [Intake Architecture](/Users/benjaminlagrone/Documents/projects/real-estate/lecrown-properties-platform/docs/intake-architecture.md)

## CRM Ops Stack

This repo now includes a dedicated EspoCRM deployment stack under:

- [ops/espocrm](/Users/benjaminlagrone/Documents/projects/real-estate/lecrown-properties-platform/ops/espocrm)

Use it as:

- same repository
- separate service

## Government Contracts

`lecrown-platform` can now ingest Texas ESBD opportunities, score likely-fit government work, and expose both ranked matches and a weekly CSV export through the admin surface and backend API.

The opportunities page now supports:

- admin auth
- keyword rule management
- agency preference management
- complete-list storage with view-only filters
- a score matrix built from closeness, timing, competition edge, and agency affinity

See:

- [docs/gov-contracts.md](/Users/benjaminlagrone/Documents/projects/real-estate/lecrown-properties-platform/docs/gov-contracts.md)
- separate runtime boundary

Repo-level commands:

```bash
make crm-init-env
make crm-up
make crm-pull
make crm-build
make crm-upgrade
make crm-logs
make crm-ps
make crm-down
```

Direct script entrypoint:

```bash
./ops/espocrm/crm.sh help
```

Recommended production subdomain:

- `crm.lecrowndevelopment.com`

## First milestone flow

1. Create a content item through `POST /content/create` or the admin UI.
2. Confirm it was stored with `GET /content/list?tenant=...`.
3. Set `LINKEDIN_TOKEN` plus the tenant org IDs in `.env`.
4. Publish with `POST /linkedin/publish`.
5. Verify the post on the matching LinkedIn organization page.

## YouTube publish flow

Use one of these credential paths per tenant:

- Set `YOUTUBE_ACCESS_TOKEN_DEV` or `YOUTUBE_ACCESS_TOKEN_PROP` directly.
- Or set `YOUTUBE_CLIENT_ID`, `YOUTUBE_CLIENT_SECRET`, and the tenant refresh token so the backend can mint an access token at publish time.

Example direct upload:

```json
{
  "tenant": "development",
  "title": "Why warehouse operations break down",
  "description": "A direct explanation of the operational failure pattern.",
  "video_path": "/videos/warehouse.mp4",
  "tags": ["property management", "warehouse"]
}
```

Example orchestrated distribution:

```json
{
  "content_id": "123",
  "channels": ["linkedin", "youtube"],
  "video_style": "corporate_clean",
  "youtube_video_path": "/videos/warehouse.mp4"
}
```

If `youtube_video_path` is omitted, the distribution service will ask the video worker to render one.

## Video worker integration

By default the platform runs in `VIDEO_RENDER_MODE=stub`, which is the safe development path while the worker contract is still being finalized.

To use an HTTP render worker:

1. Set `VIDEO_RENDER_MODE=http`
2. Set `VIDEO_SERVER_URL` to the worker base URL
3. Optionally change `VIDEO_RENDER_ENDPOINT` and `VIDEO_RENDER_DEFAULT_STYLE`

Expected worker request:

```json
{
  "content_id": "123",
  "script": "Why warehouse operations break down...",
  "title": "Why warehouse operations break down",
  "tenant": "development",
  "style": "corporate_clean",
  "tags": ["operations", "industrial"]
}
```

Expected worker response:

```json
{
  "status": "complete",
  "job_id": "job_123",
  "video_path": "/shared/outputs/video_123.mp4",
  "video_url": "http://100.x.x.x:8001/files/video_123.mp4"
}
```

Notes:

- `video_path` only works if the platform can read that path locally or via a shared mount.
- `video_url` is the safer cross-machine contract; the backend will download it temporarily before uploading to YouTube.
- Tailscale is the simplest way to make the worker reachable without exposing it publicly.

## Example payloads

### Create content

```json
{
  "tenant": "development",
  "type": "linkedin_post",
  "title": "A sharper acquisition lens",
  "body": "We underwrite deals by pressure-testing downside first.",
  "tags": ["acquisitions", "strategy"],
  "publish_linkedin": true,
  "publish_site": true
}
```

### Create inquiry

```json
{
  "tenant": "properties",
  "asset_type": "multifamily",
  "location": "Houston, TX",
  "problem": "Occupancy dropped after deferred maintenance piled up.",
  "contact_name": "Jordan Smith",
  "email": "jordan@example.com",
  "phone": "713-555-0199"
}
```

### Intake lead

```json
{
  "source_site": "askmortgageauthority.com",
  "source_type": "wordpress",
  "form_provider": "WPForms",
  "form_id": "12",
  "external_entry_id": "481",
  "page_url": "https://askmortgageauthority.com/get-pre-qualified/",
  "business_context": "AskMortgageAuthority",
  "product_context": "Mortgage",
  "metadata": {
    "campaign": "spring-search"
  },
  "lead": {
    "firstName": "Jordan",
    "lastName": "Smith",
    "emailAddress": "jordan@example.com",
    "phoneNumber": "713-555-0199",
    "description": "Looking to get pre-qualified.",
    "source": "Website"
  }
}
```

If `INTAKE_API_KEY` is configured, send:

- header `X-Intake-Key: <INTAKE_API_KEY>`

Relevant environment variables:

```dotenv
INTAKE_API_KEY=
ESPOCRM_BASE_URL=https://crm.lecrowndevelopment.com
ESPOCRM_API_KEY=
ESPOCRM_USERNAME=
ESPOCRM_PASSWORD=
ESPOCRM_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=15
```

## Notes

- Inquiry capture is restricted to the `properties` tenant.
- `POST /intake/lead` is the cross-site intake boundary; `/inquiry` is still the older tenant-specific path.
- Auth exists as a thin admin stub. Content and inquiry routes are not gated yet.
- `GET /intake/list` is gated through the current admin bearer token flow.
- `ai_video_service.py` now orchestrates remote rendering through `video_client.py` instead of assuming the API renders media itself.
- In `stub` mode, you still need to provide a usable `VIDEO_STUB_VIDEO_PATH`, `VIDEO_STUB_VIDEO_URL`, or a manual `youtube_video_path` if you want YouTube upload to succeed end-to-end.
